# CALCULATOR

## PROGRAMS REQUIRED
Addition (X Y => X+Y 0)
Subtraction (X Y => X-Y 0)
Multiplication (X Y 0 0=> X*Y 0 0 0)
Division (X Y 0 )

### like more stuff needed
chr ord functionality
infinite array handling

## USAGE (theoretically)
input first digit of first number, then next, etc until last
input symbol
input first digit of second number etc until last
input symbol 2
input first digit of second number, etc until last
...
input = or blank or space
outputs result
division should return the number always rounded down
proper order of operations should be applied
non number and non symbol means equals sign
two symbols in a row means get rid of them and then calculate

pls nothing higher than 255 ever, my brain is not big enough to do that
also how am i gonna do negative numbers!!!

okay so I've decided that it's gonna be two digit number inputs only and ill deal with negative numbers later

## PROGRESS:
- 2 digit number addition

## Doing next (aka when im procrastinating daydream):
- two digit subtraction
- one digit multiplication
- advanced chr and ord for inputs and outputs - separate function for that for x inputs


how negative numbers will be stored:
every number will be stored like this

0 S 0 N 0
