- ~~Malbolge~~ never mind thats not happening like ill write a brute forcer

# General resources
[ASCII table](https://www.ascii-code.com/)

## Whitespace 
It's hard (to read).  
Learnt using [tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/whitespace-0.4/src/docs/tutorial.html) and [compiler](https://naokikp.github.io/wsi/whitespace.html).  
Ran in terminal using [pip install whitespace](https://pypi.org/project/whitespace/)  
```bash
pip install whitespace
```

## BrainF*ck 
Easy to understand using [this excellent tutorial](https://saketupadhyay.medium.com/how-to-code-in-brainf-ck-without-losing-your-mind-6a8fd67b36b4).  
Ran in terminal using [bf-cli](https://github.com/aapzu/bf-cli).  
More learning using [Basics of BF](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)  
Very comprehensive 13 lessons by [DPAmar](https://tech.io/users/1962352/DPAmar) on tech.io, lesson 1 [here](https://tech.io/playgrounds/50426/getting-started-with-brainfuck/welcome)  
[Very good gist](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)
I'm trying to:  
- code something where you input two numbers and a function (+/-/*///) and it will do that e.g. (3\*2) returning 6
- solve leetcode problems such as palindrome checking an input string, and prime number checking, and fibonacci and decimal inputs
- base conversion
- calculate pi and output infinite digits and e 
- a game like good game idk with random etc (for this i need to decimal input aka 001-225 and y and n and takex inputs and random number 1 to x decided by input)
- interpreter/compiler in bf
- fibonnaci, pascal triangle numbers
- ~~brainfk interpreter in python pls because inputs are bugged with bf-cli~~ done
- ~~add a ? random command for 0-255 random number generator~~ done

## EXCON
It was hard to set up the interpreter because I've never done that before. Anyways my .bat setup only works on windows and it's kind of scuffed but you just go to the excon folder path and use .\excon [script] and since it can be any file extension, I used some funny extensions.  
It literally can only print ASCII characters and that's it. It can't even take inputs. Like idk what to do with it other than print everything.  

I used the ruby interpreter from the [esolang article](https://esolangs.org/wiki/EXCON#Interpreter) and used that to learn.
I then wrote a simple python script which takes an input and converts it to EXCON and then used questionable programming practices to condense it to one line.  
Then I messed around with it and became a ruby programmer.

## Befunge

WHAT ITS SO COMPLICATED AND COOL
