# General resources
[ASCII table](https://www.ascii-code.com/)

## Whitespace 
It's hard (to read).  
Learnt using [tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/whitespace-0.4/src/docs/tutorial.html) and [compiler](https://naokikp.github.io/wsi/whitespace.html).  
Ran in terminal using [pip install whitespace](https://pypi.org/project/whitespace/)  
```bash
pip install whitespace
```

## BrainF*ck 
Easy to understand using [this excellent tutorial](https://saketupadhyay.medium.com/how-to-code-in-brainf-ck-without-losing-your-mind-6a8fd67b36b4).  
Ran in terminal using [bf-cli](https://github.com/aapzu/bf-cli).

Very comprehensive 13 lessons by [DPAmar](https://tech.io/users/1962352/DPAmar) on tech.io, lesson 1 [here](https://tech.io/playgrounds/50426/getting-started-with-brainfuck/welcome)  
[Very good gist](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)
I'm trying to:  
- code something where you input two numbers and a function (+/-/*///) and it will do that e.g. (3\*2) returning 6
- solve leetcode problems such as palindrome checking an input string, and prime number checking, and fibonacci and decimal inputs
- base conversion
- calculate pi
- a game like good game idk with random etc
- interpreter/compiler
- fibonnaci, pascal triangle numbers
